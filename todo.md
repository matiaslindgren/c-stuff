# TODO

- [ ] unify initialization and destruction API
- [ ] replace dynamic allocations with paged memory arena
- [ ] implement non-allocating args parser

- [ ] cleanup and comment DEFLATE decoder, implement simple compression
- [ ] benchmark CRC32 as hash function, collisions etc
- [ ] cleanup hashmap of unnecessary code, doesn't need e.g. insert
- [ ] optimize huffman code tree
- [ ] handle different PNG color types
- [ ] verify the IO header handles all errors gracefully
- [ ] implement more and better math stuff
- [ ] use iterator API in PNG chunks parsing
- [ ] output all text as JSON
- [ ] fix rand lib seeds
- [ ] benchmark sorting, especially edge cases
- [ ] replace str lib with unicode strings
- [ ] replace all c-strings with unicode
- [ ] separate tests from other headers
- [ ] refactor entire stufflib into components, compile as static library, link manually
- [ ] benchmark utf-8 decoder
- [ ] implement log levels and replace `STUFFLIB_LOG` macros as no-ops if level too low
